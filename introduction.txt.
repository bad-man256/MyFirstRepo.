# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Boss Muhanguzi, and I am excited to be part of the Linux Week One Pathway Program. I am passionate about technology and eager to deepen my understanding of Linux, which is a powerful operating system widely used in many industries. Through this program, I hope to build strong foundational skills in Linux commands and system management that will support my journey in software engineering and IT.
